//     "Or the Pocket Cube is a version of the Rubik's cube with just two layers. It is also called the Mini Cube. This Pocket Cube might seem very simple to solve at first glance, but it has more than 3.6 million possible permutations! Mind-boggling, isn't it? There are only four stickers on each face of this cube as compared to the colour patterns of the Rubik's Cube. Therefore, the solution is to twist the cube around and pave your own path.",

It's a mechanism, algorithms and notations are quite similar to the Rubik's Cube. However, the four centrepieces are held together by a hidden centre. There are many more modifications and variants of the Rubik's Revenge that are built on the same mechanism and concept.",

This is approximate to the number of atoms in the universe. The method of solving the 5x5 cube is similar to that of the classic puzzle and involves solving the centres, pairing the pieces to create the edges and finally solving it like a 3x3 cube.",
